## TrackSSL
<p>This is the prototype of a self-supervised machine learning sound track classification plugin for your DAWs. It learns the encoded features of the tracks being used for mix and learns to project the features to a different space that is more intuitive for artists (2d/3d). With the right GUI design, this could help the productivity of your production workflow. </p>

##### Update:11/26:
<p> Finished setting up encoder training pipeline, needs to train mapper from the encoded space</p>
